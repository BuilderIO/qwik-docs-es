# Netlify Edge Adapter

Qwik City Netlify Edge adapter allows you to connect Qwik City to [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/).

## Installation

To integrate the `netlify-edge` adapter, use the `add` command:

```shell
npm run qwik add netlify-edge
```

> It will automatically install the required dependencies, including the [Netlify CLI](https://cli.netlify.com/).

The adapter will add a new `vite.config.ts` within the `adapters/` directory, and a new entry file will be created, such as:

```shell
└── adapters/
    └── netlify-edge/
        └── vite.config.ts
└── src/
    └── entry.netlify-edge.tsx
```

Additionally, within the `package.json`, the `build.server` and `deploy` scripts will be updated.

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

[Read the full guide here](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/blob/main/starters/adapters/netlify-edge/README.md)

## Dev deploy

To deploy the application for development:

```shell
npm run deploy
```

Notice that you might need a [Netlify account](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/) in order to complete this step!

## Production deploy

After installing the integration using `npm run qwik add netlify-edge`, the project is ready to be deployed to Netlify. However, you will need to create a git repository and push the code to it.

Please refer to the Netlify docs for more information on how to deploy your site: [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/)

## Advanced

### Netlify Edge Entry Middleware

When the `netlify-edge` adapter is added, a new entry file will be created at `src/entry.netlify-edge.tsx`. Below is an example of using the built-in middleware within the entry file.

```tsx title="src/entry.netlify-edge.tsx"
import { createQwikCity } from '@builder.io/qwik-city/middleware/netlify-edge';
import qwikCityPlan from '@qwik-city-plan';
import render from './entry.ssr';

export default createQwikCity({ render, qwikCityPlan });
```

The compiled middleware will be built in the `.netlify/edge-functions` directory.

### Netlify Edge Functions Declarations

[Netlify Edge Functions declarations](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/declarations/) can be configured to run on specific URL patterns. Each edge function declaration associates one site path pattern with one function to execute on requests that match the path. A single request can execute a chain of edge functions from a series of declarations. A single edge function can be associated with multiple paths across various declarations.

This is useful to determine if a page response should be Server-Side Rendered (SSR) or if the response should use a static-site generated (SSG) `index.html` file instead.

By default, the Netlify Edge adapter will generate a `.netlify/edge-middleware/manifest.json` file, which is used by the Netlify deployment to determine which paths should, and should not, use edge functions.

To override the generated manifest, you can [add a declaration](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/declarations/#add-a-declaration) to the `netlify.toml` using the `[[edge_functions]]` config. For example:

```toml title="netlify.toml"
[[edge_functions]]
  path = "/admin"
  function = "auth"
```

### Netlify Request Context

[Netlify context](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/api/#netlify-specific-context-object) is available in endpoint method's `platform` param:

```ts
export const onRequest = async ({ platform }) => {
  platform.log('requested ip:', platform.ip);
};
```

Additionally, you may import the `RequestHandlerNetlify` type to have have type completions in your editor.

```tsx
import { type RequestHandlerNetlify } from '@builder.io/qwik-city/middleware/netlify-edge';

export const onGet: RequestHandlerNetlify = ({ platform }) => {
  //...
};
```

### Environment variables

```ts
export const onRequest = async ({ env }) => {
  platform.log('netlify serverless env read from Netlify UI or CLI', env.get('API_KEY'));
};
```

### Migration

Previous versions of Qwik City used the `@netlify/vite-plugin-netlify-edge` plugin. This plugin still works great, but uses a "catch-all" approach, which means all requests will go through the edge functions, to include static files.

The updated adapter, using the `npm run qwik add netlify-edge` command, will instead generate a `.netlify/edge-functions/manifest.json` config at build-time. If you would like to use the new adapter, you can remove the `@netlify/vite-plugin-netlify-edge` plugin from the root `vite.config.ts` file, and the root `netlify.toml` file.

```diff title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { qwikVite } from "@builder.io/qwik/optimizer";
import { qwikCity } from "@builder.io/qwik-city/vite";
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";
-import netlifyEdge from "@netlify/vite-plugin-netlify-edge";

export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      qwikCity(),
      qwikVite({
-        ssr: {
-          outDir: "netlify/edge-functions",
-        },
      }),
      tsconfigPaths(),
-      netlifyEdge({
-        functionName: "entry.netlify-edge",
-      }),
    ],
  };
});
```

Remove the catch-all `edge_functions` config from `netlify.toml`

```diff title="netlify.toml"
-[[edge_functions]]
-path = "/*"
-function = "entry.netlify-edge"
```
