# Google Cloud Run Middleware

Qwik City Cloud Run middleware allows you to run a Qwik City app [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

## Installation

To integrate the `Cloud Run` adapter, use the `add` command:

```shell
npm run qwik add cloud-run
```

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Production deploy

After running `npm run build` you will have 2 build folders.

- The `dist` folder will be created including all the static files.
- The `server` folder will be created including all node server files.

To deploy the server, make sure you have created an account and authenticated with the gcloud CLI.

You will also need to update the name of your Cloud Run app in the `deploy` script in your package.json.

You can then run this command to deploy your app:

```shell
npm run deploy
```
