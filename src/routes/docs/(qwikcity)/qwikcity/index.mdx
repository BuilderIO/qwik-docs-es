# Qwik City (routing)

_aka. Qwik Router_

Learning Qwik and Qwik City are not two different things, Qwik City is built on top of Qwik, bringing opinionated routing and goodies to make your life easier.

> [**Qwik¹**](/docs/(qwik)/index.mdx): Core framework, stable, primitives, component model.

We call it a **meta-framework** for Qwik. Qwik City is to Qwik, what [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is to React, what [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) is to Vue, or [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to Svelte.

Qwik (core) and Qwik City (routing) solve problems at two layers of abstraction. **Qwik can stay stable**, without breaking changes, focusing on long-term and stable primitives, while Qwik City brings an **opinionated and performant way to build sites at scale**. We don't want to lock the ecosystem into a single correct way of building sites, in fact we encourage the community to build alternative solutions on top of Qwik.

> As a user, using Qwik City today for your app is a no-brainer. Thanks to Qwik architecture, it comes with zero overhead, meaning that no extra JS will be delivered to the browser.

Use Qwik City to build an e-commerce website, blog site, or any other website that needs routing, layouts, templating, or data retrieval/updates. Qwik City is built on Qwik, and therefore Qwik City sites are resumable and only download the minimal amount of JavaScript with fine-grained lazy loading.

Qwik City provides:

- Directory-based routing
- Nested layouts
- File-based menus
- Breadcrumbs
- Support authoring content with `.tsx` or `.mdx` file formats
- Data endpoints

By default, Qwik City sites are fast because they:

- Are resumable
- Download minimal JavaScript
- Come with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io)
