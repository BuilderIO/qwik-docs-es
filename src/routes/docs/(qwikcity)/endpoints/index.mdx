# Endpoints

Endpoints are `index.ts` files in the `src/routes` directory that does not export a `default` component. Instead, it exports a `onRequest`, `onGet`, `onPost`, `onPut`, `onDelete`, `onPatch`, `onHead` function, which will be used to handle the incoming request.

```tsx
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

// Called when the HTTP method is GET
export const onGet: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => {
  // Respond with a JSON object
  requestEvent.json(200, { hello: 'world' });
};
```

Endpoints are useful when you need to expose some external API, for example a RESTful API, or a GraphQL API, by an external entity such as a mobile app or a third-party service.

```ts
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

// Called with every HTTP request (regardless of method)
export const onRequest: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => { ... }
 
// Called when the HTTP method is GET
export const onGet: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => { ... }
 
// Called when the HTTP method is POST
export const onPost: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => { ... }
 
// Called when the HTTP method is PUT
export const onPut: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => { ... }
 
// Called when the HTTP method is PATCH
export const onPatch: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => { ... }
 
// Called when the HTTP method is DELETE
export const onDelete: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => { ... }
```

## Endpoints vs server$

Endpoints are low level APIs that give developers full control over the HTTP response. The are only recommended when you need to create an API to be consumed by an external entity such as a mobile app or a third-party service.

The `server$` functions are usually a better option when you need to run some code on the server and return a response back to the app. The `server$` are strongly typed and provide a more convenient API for returning data.

## Raw Response Control

Endpoints give developers full control over the HTTP response. This allows endpoints to implement RESTful APIs, JSON, XML, GraphQL APIs, reverse proxies or any other type of API.

All endpoint functions are passed a `RequestEvent` object, which contains the HTTP request and response information.

```ts
export interface RequestEvent {
  /**
   * HTTP response headers.
   *
   * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header
   */
  readonly headers: Headers;

  /**
   * HTTP request and response cookie. Use the `get()` method to retrieve a request cookie value.
   * Use the `set()` method to set a response cookie value.
   *
   * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies
   */
  readonly cookie: Cookie;

```

### JSON GET Endpoint

Creating a JSON endpoint is as simple as calling the `json(status, object)` method. The `json()` method will automatically set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json; charset=utf-8` and JSON stringify the data.

```tsx
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

interface ProductData {
  skuId: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => {
  // Get the product from the database
  const product: ProductData = await database.get(requestEvent.params.skuId);

  // Send the product as JSON
  requestEvent.json(200, product);
};
```

### Changing the status code

Endpoints can manually change the HTTP status code of the response, using the `status()` method.

```tsx
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => {
  requestEvent.status(404);
};
```

### Adding response headers

Endpoints can manually add response headers to the response, using the `headers` property.

```tsx
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const onPost: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => {
  requestEvent.headers.set('X-My-Custom-Header', 'Hello World');
};
```

### Setting a cookie

Endpoints can manually read and set cookies, using the `cookie` property. This might be useful for setting a session cookie, such as a JWT token, or a cookie to track a user.

```tsx
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => {
  // Read a cookie
  requestEvent.cookie.get('my-cookie');

  // Set a cookie
  requestEvent.cookie.set('my-cookie', 'Hello World');
};
```


### Sending a Text body

Creating a text endpoint is as simple as calling the `text(status, string)` method. The `text()` method will automatically set the `Content-Type` header to `text/plain; charset=utf-8`.

```tsx
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => {
  requestEvent.text(200, 'Hello World');
};
```

### Sending a RAW response

Creating a raw endpoint is as simple as calling the `send(Response)` method. The `send()` method takes a standard `Response` object, which can be created using the `Response` constructor.

```tsx
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => {
  const response = new Response('Hello World', {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
    },
  });
  requestEvent.send(response);
};
```

### Create a reverse proxy using a fetch

A reverse proxy can be created by using the `fetch()` method to make a request to another server, and then using the `send()` method to send the response back to the client.

```tsx
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://example.com');
  requestEvent.send(response);
};
```

### Create a stream response manually

Endpoints can manually write to the HTTP response stream, using the `getWritableStream()` method. This can be useful for creating a streaming endpoint, such as a server-sent events endpoint.

```tsx
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const onGet: RequestHandler = async (requestEvent) => {
  const writableStream = requestEvent.getWritableStream();
  const writer = writableStream.getWriter();
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  
  writer.write(encoder.encode('Hello World'));
  await wait(100);
  writer.write(encoder.encode('After 100ms'));
  await wait(100);
  writer.write(encoder.encode('After 200ms'));
  await wait(100);
  writer.write(encoder.encode('END'));
  writer.close();
};

const wait = (ms: number) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
```
