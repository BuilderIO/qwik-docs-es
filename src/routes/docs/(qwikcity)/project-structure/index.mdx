```bash
qwik-app-demo

├── package.json
├── public
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── router-head

│   └── routes
│       ├── flower
│       │   ├── flower.css
│       │   └── index.tsx

## Project files

### `src/routes/`

The `src/routes/` directory is a special directory for Qwik City since it's the directory where Qwik City will look for your pages. Folders and files inside this directory have a special meaning and they will be mapped to the URL of your app.

- `src/routes/index.tsx` is the homepage of your app.
- `src/routes/layout.tsx` is the root layout of your app, all pages will be rendered inside this layout.

> Refer to the [Routing](/qwikcity/routing) section for more information.

### `src/components/`

The `src/components/` directory is a directory by convention. All Qwik starters will have this directory, but you can change it if you want. This directory is where you should put your components, ie, reusable pieces of code that can be used in multiple places. They are not routes or layouts, but they can be used inside them.

For example, a `Button` component should be inside `src/components/button/button.tsx`.

### `public/`

The `public/` directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and icons. When you build your app, these files will be copied to the `dist/` directory and served at the root.

Refer to [Vite configuration for more information](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#public-base-path).

### `src/entry.ssr.tsx`

SSR entry point, in all cases the application is rendered outside the browser, this entry point will be the common one.

- Server (express, cloudflare...)
- npm run start
- npm run preview
- npm run build

### `src/root.tsx`

The `src/root.tsx` file is the entry point for the application tree. It's the first component that will be rendered. It's the root of the tree.

### `src/global.css`

The `src/global.css` file is a global CSS file, if you need to define some CSS that is used in multiple places in your app, you can define it here.

The root component (`src/root.tsx`) imports this file by default.

### `tsconfig.json`

The `tsconfig.json` file contains the TypeScript compiler configuration. It's standard for any TypeScript project.

### `vite.config.ts`

Qwik uses Vite to build the project. The `vite.config.ts` file contains the Vite configuration. It's standard for any Vite project. Please refer to the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/) for more information.
