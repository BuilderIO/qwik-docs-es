# Static Assets

Use `/public` folder to store all static assets such as images, fonts, etc.

All static assets are served from your server's root (`/` as in `https://example.com/`) folder and superimposed under your routes (routes have priority).

```bash
public/
├── favicon.ico           # https://example.com/favicon.ico
└── images/
    └── logo.png          # https://example.com/images/logo.png
```
