# Tailwind

Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides us with single-purpose utility classes which are
opinionated for the most part, and which help us design our web pages from right inside our
markup or `.js/.jsx/.ts/.tsx/.mdx` files. [Tailwindcss Website](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Usage

You can add Tailwind easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

```shell
npm run qwik add tailwind
```

The previous command updates your app with the necessary dependencies.

It also adds new files inside to your project folder:

- `postcss.config.js`
- `tailwind.config.js`
- `.vscode/settings.json`

and modifies your `src/global.css` to include

```css title="src/global.css"

# global.css file

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

...stuff...

```
