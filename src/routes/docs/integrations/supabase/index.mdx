# Supabase

The `Supabase` JS library plays nicely with the server-side APIs from Qwik such as `routeLoader$`, `routeAction$` or `server$`.

First, install supabase in your Qwik project:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js supabase-auth-helpers-qwik
```

The second step would be to add configure the `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` as environment variables to `.env` file, the "anon" key is safe to be exposed in the client-side.

```bash
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxxxx.supabase.co
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhb.......
```

You should be able to get this values from the Supabase dashboard, create a new `.env.local` file at the root of the project and paste them there.

> Note: It's possible to use Supabase with Qwik completely client-side, however, you would lose some of the performance benefits that you can acheive with leveraging the server. For a working example and code head over to [this repository](https://github.com/hamatoyogi/qwik-supabase-example).

## Server-side

The Supabase client can now be used server-side - in `routeLoader`s and `routeAction`s - by calling the `createServerClient` function.

```tsx
import { routeLoader$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { createServerClient } from 'supabase-auth-helpers-qwik';

export const useDBTest = routeLoader$(async (requestEv) => {
  const supabaseClient = createServerClient(
    import.meta.env.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
    import.meta.env.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
    requestEv
  );
  const { data } = await supabaseClient.from('test').select('*')
  return { data };
});
```
