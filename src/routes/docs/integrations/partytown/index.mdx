# Partytown

Third party scripts slow down your initial page load substantially by blocking the main thread.

Partytown is a tool that allows you to defer third party scripts like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc off the main thread by using a web worker.
For more information about this tool visit the [Partytown docs](https://partytown.builder.io/).

## Usage

You can add Partytown easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

```shell
npm run qwik add partytown
```

The previous command updates your app and sets the correct configuration in `vite.config.ts`.

It also adds new files inside to your `components` folder.

```tsx title="src/root.tsx"
import { QwikPartytown } from './components/partytown/partytown';

export default component$(() => {
  return (
    <QwikCityProvider>
      <head>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <QwikPartytown forward={['dataLayer.push']} />
        <script
          async
          type="text/partytown"
          src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXX"
        />
      </head>
      <body lang="en"></body>
    </QwikCityProvider>
  );
});
```
