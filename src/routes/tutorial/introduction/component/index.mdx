Welcome to the Qwik tutorial. This is a series of short tutorials that will help you get started with Qwik. The introduction is a set of problems that will teach you how to create a component, store data, attach listeners, and fetch data from the server. So let's get started.

## Creating a component

Use the editor on the right to create a UI that looks something like this:

```
GitHub organization: __________
- Qwik
- Partytown
```

The HTML code for this component should be this:

```HTML
<main>
  <p>
    <label>
      GitHub organization:
      <input value="BuilderIO" />
    </label>
  </p>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik">Qwik</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown">Partytown</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</main>
```

You can click the "Show Me" button in the bottom left to see the completed solution.
