This example features a store that contains other objects rather than just primitives. The `store.counter` property is an object literal.

The example doesn't work as is, because by default the `useStore` function only watches top-level properties.

To make the example work, you need to do one of two things:

1. Wrap `{count:0}` in another [`useStore()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/state/index.mdx#usestore) call (which is a bit cumbersome)

1. Allow `useStore` to recursively apply reactivity to all properties by passing the additional argument: `{deep:true}`.

> **Your task:** Update the sample with the [`useStore()`](/docs/(qwik)/components/state/index.mdx#usestore) function.

Note that stores are not tied to any single component. In fact, you can pass stores from one component to another.
