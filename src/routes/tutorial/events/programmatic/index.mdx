There are times when your app needs to add a conditional listener. Sometimes a listener name is unknown, or you need to use an imperative approach to set up a listener.

Qwik provides the following functions to attach a listener:

| Function          | Description                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useOn()`         | Add an event on specific event on current host element. |
| `useOnDocument()` | Add an event on specific event on document.             |
| `useOnWindow()`   | Add an event on specific event on window.               |

> **Your task**: Set up a click listener on the component to call `alert('Hello world!')`.

## Understanding the `$`

The `$` function signals Qwik to lazy load a reference. When setting up a listener with `useOn`, the second argument is a [Qwik URL](../../../docs/(qwik)/advanced/qrl/index.mdx).

Qwik URLs (QRL) are lazy-loadable references to your code. If `useOn` took a function directly rather than QRL, it would have to eagerly execute to allocate the listener closure. By using a QRL via the `$` function, Qwik can lazy load the closure only as `click` listener is triggered.
